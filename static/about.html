        <h1> What our application is about...</h1>
        <p>The application that we chose to implement is a Lego Web Application Service. The web service is a lego tracker where you enter the lego model and color and store the data. It serves as an inventory for the legos you have. The application will also include many different details as well for it to be a better user experience.
